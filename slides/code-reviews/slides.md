## What is a code review?

	<li class="fragment">review</li>

### Why we actually do code reviews?

<aside class="notes">
	ask people
</aside>

---

Code Improvements

<aside class="notes">
	code reviews over time is a distribution of knowledge. If you did not learn anything about the area it was not as good as it could have been.
</aside>

---

Finding Alternative Solutions

---

Knowledge Transfer

---

Increased Team Awareness

---

Getting up speed

---

Shared Code Ownership

---

Code is a craft Show it off

---

If fast enough almost feels like pair programming

---

Learning new things

<aside class="notes">you don't have to watch over reviews but it helps</aside>

---

‚ÄúCode review is a discipline of explaining your code to your peers [that] drives a higher standard of coding. I think <u>**the process is even more important than the result**</u>.‚Äù

### So What is code review?

## Bad Practices

---

LGTM üëç

---

TL;DR;
<blockquote class="fragment">"Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, they'll find 10 issues. Ask them to do 500 lines  and they'll say it all looks good" - @girayozil</blockquote>

---

Should never be a formality!

---

Multiple Issues in a single PR

---

Nitpicking

---

While You Are At It!

---

Very Slow Turnarounds

---

Insecurity

<aside class="notes">
	<li>fear</li>
	<li>When corrected -> You are getting smarter!</li>
</aside>

---

No One Believes in Code Revies

## Good Code Review

---

### Before code review

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">make sure you really understand the task</li>
	<li class="fragment">get to know with the code if any</li>
	<li class="fragment">think about the testing</li>
	<li class="fragment">think about the implementation</li>
	<li class="fragment">discuss the design of your code we others</li>
	<li class="fragment">make sure everything is clear</li>
	<li class="fragment">code, diff, commit, code, diff, commit, code, diff, commit...</li>
	<li class="fragment">push</li>
</ul>

---

### Actual Code Review

---

Objective and Not personal

---

Focus on design and implementation

---

Is the code SOLID

<p class="fragment">How easy it is to isolate this code and test it?</p>

---

Focus Code Smells

<aside class="notes">
	- Do you know what a code smell is?
	- Can you list 5?
</aside>

---

Should make QE obsolete :D

## As an author

---

> "If content is the King - then context is the **God**" - Gary Vaynerchuck

<aside class="notes">We need to provide excellent and sufficient context about our changes</aside>

---

### At first it will be very painful but it pays in the long run

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">Context understanding is one of the most important things</li>
	<li class="fragment">Adds a lot of documentation around the change</li>
	<li class="fragment">People can learn something from this</li>
	<li class="fragment">All of this comments added as context gets to live in the commit when we merge the pull request</li>
</ul>

---

Do atomic commits
	
---
	
Review your own code before asking for review
	
---
	
Add the link to the pull request in the ticket

---

Pull request template

## As a reviewer

---

Ask, Don't tell

---

Avoid conflict

---

Encourage discussion 

---

Demands are not well received

---

Be positive

---

Give credit - especially if you learn something you saw something cool

---

Talk about the code and avoid talking about you

<aside class="notes">
	a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions
</aside>

---

Be time aware
	-> If there is time go for the one percent extra - try to push do person to do even better. And be sure no one likes to change names when he needed to ship this yesterday

Seniority does not matter

<aside class="notes">
	everyone could male a mistake, spot a nasty bug or give an amazing idea<br>
	after you have seen all these tricks you will probably start noticing them - this really means the other person is trying not to be an ass and guide you to see a different perspective

<!-- 
- In Practice 
	- Insist oh high quality reviews and let's agree to disagree :)
	- Review what is important to you
 -->

## Automation

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">Code Style</li>
	<li class="fragment">Conventions</li>

## Merging

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">Who - has to be comfortable fixing if shit hits the fan</li>
	<li class="fragment">Delete your branch</li>
</ul>

***

## What is the Outcome

---

Strong code review culture

---

Better Code

<aside class="notes">discussions improve the solutions</aside>

---

Better developers

<aside class="notes">you will be reading code and writing code - we are getting the best of each-other</aside>

---

Team ownership

<aside class="notes">the whole team will own the code</aside>

Healthy debate

<aside class="notes">A lot team do even have debate, just silent disagreement and do not liking something</aside>
