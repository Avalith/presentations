# Better Code Reviews
<small>[Alexander Ivanov](mailto:a.ivanov@shutterfly.com)</small>


***

I do not think I ever did like a formal introductory meeting with the team and I feel pretty bad about this and want to fix this asap but I still want to be aligned.


What I expect
What you should expect
What Annoys me
What are our plans


Short term team rotations (search: link moral, KT)
Are you a hands-on boss, overseer or highly involved manager?
I like to have visibility over everything to be able ot help
Be clear about what goes into your decision making and how you’ll evaluate the team’s progress


## Values

```
# We value participation 
Which means shared ownership. Caring about the work and stepping up to fix problems - See something say something. Sharing your opinion allows us to achieve better solutions.

# We value collaboration
We value sharing opinions and bouncing ideas off of each other. It is like flying person and a laser shooting person realizing they can team up to become the flying laser superhero combo

# We value speed
We value speed and encourage everyone to quickly gather people when they need help. 

# We value diversity
We believe that with diversity comes a better product, better decisions and better work environment. 

# We value personal growth & development
We value and heavily invest in personal growth & development.
- We think formal performance reviews are rigid and ineffective. Instead, we talk to each other on an ongoing basis. --- A joke about having conversations (aww awkward)...

This allows us to quickly change things to assure you are learning, growing and getting what you need to succeed personally and professionally. 

# We value transparency
Everyone's work is informed by the high-level business goals. So you should never NOT know what you are doing 

# We value intellectual honesty
We value intellectual honesty and asking for help. We know "startups" can be demanding. Be honest with yourself and recognize you need to ask for help. It is expected and wanted. The truth matters more than saving face. Here asking for help is not a sign of weakness - it's a sign of strength. Furthermore, the expectation is that when you come here, you will be willing to help others as well. 

# We value each other
I mean we just straight up like each other. I like him, her (do point at people) ... and everyone else here. Because everyone is really cool and I like you.

Misc

Talk about the user growth and monthly 1:1s
Feel free to get me whenever you need to do so.


Code Quality
----
This is also one of the things I'd like to be pushing for. This includes:

- Automated code quality checks
- Code review checklists
- REFACTORING and paying the technical debt (cns-client, pip-client, store-client, service in appcode, etc.)

My Personal Goals
---
- I want to see AppCode gone away from all our projects
- I want to see high-quality code
- I am noticing a design problem and this is a huge problem for me I will be addressing
- I hope you have already noticed - I am here to help! help you do your job, make it a pleasurable experience as much as possible and grow
- I want CGD to succeed
- I want Shutterfly to succeed



IDEAS
---

- have a CGD team retrospective
- open communication
- knowledge spread
- Do a presentation that should be engaging
